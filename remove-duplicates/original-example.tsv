The provision of personal and professional support to elite athletes is important for the well-being and success of the athlete, with various studies advocating a holistic approach to performance enhancement. However, little is known about social support experiences in elite para-swimming. Swimming is a popular Paralympic sport and the British para swimmers have been very successful in recent years, most recently winning 47 medals at Rio 2016. This study will be the first to explore the lived experiences of British Paralympic swimmers with respect to the personal and professional support available, perceived use of the support network and the influence it has on well-being and performance. Methods and analysis A hermeneutic phenomenological study will be undertaken using a subtle-realist paradigmatic view. A purposive sample of British Paralympic swimmers will be recruited to enable exploration of social support experiences. In-depth semistructured interviews will explore participants' experiences of being an elite para-athlete, their support network, the social support available and how they perceive it relates to their well-being and performance. Strategies including reflexivity and member checking will be used to ensure trustworthiness. Data will be analysed following the Framework Method; a seven-stage process used for qualitative data analysis. Ethics and dissemination This study has ethical approval (ERN_20-0344) granted by the University of Birmingham in April 2020. The findings of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated to key stakeholders in elite para-sport to inform support services and improve athlete well-being and performance.

AF is a potentially long-term condition that needs management, and as such primary care pharmacists may have a substantial role in supporting the management of AF. ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the role of primary care pharmacists, working in community pharmacies and general practices (GPs), in supporting the management of AF. Furthermore, this study investigates pharmacists' confidence in their knowledge and their attitudes towards incorporating AF-associated mobile apps use into their current practice. MethodsA qualitative study was conducted, using one-to-one semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews with primary care pharmacists. The topic guide was developed based on pharmacy visits and included the most relevant constructs from the 'consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR)'. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed until saturation was achieved, guided by Braun and Clarke's 6-step research method. This study was given a favourable opinion on 5 September 2019 by the University of Birmingham (UOB) Research Ethics Committee (Reference ERN_19-0908). ResultsThematic saturation was achieved after 11 interviews with primary care pharmacists (seven community pharmacists, and four GP pharmacists). Three main themes emerged relating to (1) the clinical role of pharmacists in the management of AF; (2) knowledge and awareness; and (3) prioritisation of resources. The first highlighted that primary care pharmacists were an underutilised resource within AF management. The second demonstrated that pharmacists, especially those based in the community, felt a lack of confidence in their knowledge of AF and its management, mainly community pharmacists due to other roles taking precedence over clinical roles. Both community and GP pharmacists expressed the need to have further training in this therapeutic area to be able to effectively support patients with AF. The third shed light on the pharmacists' views relating to the technological revolution in healthcare. Pharmacists expressed an interest in using apps to support their current practice. ConclusionsPrimary care pharmacists supported an extended care to AF management from screening to consultations, yet the provision of such services remains limited and inconsistent. Future research should focus on understanding the ways in which pharmacists' role can be adapted toward greater involvement in clinical care.	English	Article

Methods: Database search of international registries and a survey of RCs in the European Reference Network for rare endocrine conditions (Endo-ERN) with an overall response rate of 82%. Results: Of the 42 conditions with orphacodes currently covered within Endo-ERN, international registries exist for 32 (76%). Of 27 registries identified in the Orphanet and RD-Connect databases, Endo-ERN RCs were aware of 11 (41%). Of 21 registries identified by the RC, RD-Connect and Orphanet did not have a record of 10 (48%). Of the 29 glucose RCs, the awareness and participation rate in an international registry was highest for rare diabetes at 75 and 56% respectively. Of the 37 sex development RCs, the corresponding rates were highest for disorders of sex development at 70 and 52%. Of the 33 adrenal RCs, the rates were highest for adrenocortical tumours at 68 and 43%. Of the 43 pituitary RCs, the rates were highest for pituitary adenomas at 43 and 29%. Of the 31 genetic tumour RCs, the rates were highest for MEN1 at 26 and 9%. For the remaining conditions, awareness and participation in registries was less than 25%. Conclusion: Although there is a need to develop new registries for rare endocrine conditions, there is a more immediate need to improve the awareness and participation in existing registries.

Web of Science			10.1515/nzsth-2016-0014	Kryptic or cryptic? The Divine Preconscious Model of the Incarnation as a concrete-nature Christology	2016	Arcadi, JM	NEUE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SYSTEMATISCHE THEOLOGIE UND RELIGIONSPHILOSOPHIE	Andrew Ter Ern Loke has proffered a creative, novel, and bold model of the Incarnation as a contribution to analytic theological discussions of Christology. Recent work in this field has offered a distinction between abstract-nature and concrete-nature conceptions of natures. The former holds that entities have properties which entail their membership in a particular kind, the latter holds that being a member of a certain kind entails the having of certain properties. Loke's model, what he calls the Divine Preconscious Model, holds that at the Incarnation the divine attributes of the Word were submerged into the Word's preconscious, while the conscious of the Word took on certain human properties. This model, Loke holds, entails Christ's full divinity and full humanity without falling into Apollinarianism or Nestorianism. However, I argue that because Loke avers that his model runs on a concrete-nature account of natures, he is not able to maintain the full humanity of Christ. I suggest two ways Loke might be able to maintain the integrity of his model, either by embracing a form of neo-Apollinarianism or by adopting the abstract-nature perspective of natures.

Error awareness deficits are also found in major depressive disorder (MDD), but have not been examined in the MDD that follows a TBI (TBI-MDD). This study assessed neural activity related to error awareness in TBI-MDD. Four groups completed a response inhibition task while EEG was recorded-healthy controls (N=15), MDD-only (N=15), TBI-only (N=16), and TBI-MDD (N=12). Error related EEG activity was compared using powerful randomisation statistics that included all electrodes and time points. Participants with TBI-MDD displayed less frontally distributed neural activity, suggesting reduced contribution from frontal generating sources. Neural activity during this time window is thought to reflect conscious awareness of errors. The TBI-only and MDD-only groups did not differ from controls, and early error processing was unaffected, suggesting early error detection is intact. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Web of Science		18457508	10.1162/jocn.2008.20161	The Role of Awareness in Processing of Oculomotor Capture: Evidence from Event-related Potentials	2008	Belopolsky, AV; Kramer, AF; Theeuwes, J	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE	Previous research has shown that task-irrelevant onsets trigger an eye movement in their direction. Such oculomotor capture is often impervious to conscious awareness. The present study used event-related brain potentials to examine how such oculomotor errors are detected, evaluated, and compensated for and whether awareness of an error played a role at any of these stages of processing. The results show that the early processes of error detection and correction (as represented by the error-related negativity and the parietal N1) are not directly affected by subjective awareness of making an error. Instead, they seem to be modulated by the degree of temporal overlap between the programming of the correct and erroneous saccade. We found that only a later component (the error-related positivity [Pe]) is modulated by awareness of making an erroneous eye movement. We propose that awareness of oculomotor capture primarily depends on this later process.	English	Article
Web of Science		27129675	10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.04.036	The content of lexical stimuli and self-reported physiological state modulate error-related negativity amplitude	2016	Benau, EM; Moelter, ST	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR	The Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Correct-Response Negativity (CRN) are brief event-related potential (ERP) components elicited after the commission of a response associated with motivation, emotion, and affect. The Error Positivity (Pe) typically appears after the ERN, and corresponds to awareness of having committed an error. Although motivation has long been established as an important factor in the expression and morphology of the ERN, physiological state has rarely been explored as a variable in these investigations. In the present study, we investigated whether self-reported physiological state (SAPS; wakefulness, hunger, or thirst) corresponds with ERN amplitude and type of lexical stimuli. Participants completed a SRPS questionnaire and then completed a speeded Lexical Decision Task with words and pseudowords that were either food-related or neutral. Though similar in frequency and length, food-related stimuli elicited increased accuracy, faster errors, and generated a larger ERN and smaller CRN than neutral words. Self-reported thirst correlated with improved accuracy and smaller ERN and CRN amplitudes. The Pe and Pc (correct positivity) were not impacted by physiological state or by stimulus content. The results indicate that physiological state and manipulations of lexical content may serve as important avenues for future research. Future studies that apply more sensitive measures of physiological and motivational state (e.g., biomarkers for satiety) or direct manipulations of satiety may be a useful technique for future research into response monitoring.

Web of Science			10.1016/j.jort.2020.100348	Customer-to-customer interactions (CCIs) among older customers of outdoor recreational services: Implications for well-being	2021	Bianchi, C; Drennan, J	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT	Previous research on older customers' well-being has not addressed how customer-to-customer interactions (CCIs) can improve the well-being for older adults in outdoor recreational services. The objective of this study is to examine this gap in the literature, drawing on a value co-creation approach. Data is collected by in-depth interviews with 26 older customers (+55 years), of two outdoor recreational services in Australia, social dancing and sailing, which involve abundant interaction among customers. The findings identify four general well-being outcomes for older customers of these recreational services that emerge from value co-creation activities held during CCIs: (1) personal growth and learning, (2) sense of mastery and self-confidence, (3) positive relationships with others, and (4) self-acceptance and improved mental health. The findings are useful for managers of recreational services for elderly, government boards, community centers, and public policy makers. Management Implications: Sev-eral man-age-r-ial sug-ges-tions are pro-vided to man-agers of recre-ational services, pol-i-cy-mak-ers, and gov-ern-ment as-sis-tance pro-grams for older adults. The re-sults sug-gest that outdoor recre-ational ser-vices 1. are not only use-ful to the older pop-u-la-tion for leisure pur-poses, but also for im-prov-ing different di-men-sions of their well-be-ing. 2. should im-ple-ment train-ing pro-grams for their em-ploy-ees to in-crease their aware-ness of how CCIs can im-prove older cus-tomers' well-be-ing and there-fore en-cour-age and em-power them to en-gage in in-ter-ac-tions with other cus-tomers. 3. should also re-design their ser-vice of-fer-ings for older customers and con-sider gen-er-at-ing instances for frequent so-cial in-ter-ac-tions and ac-tiv-i-ties among cus-tomers dur-ing or af-ter the ser-vice pro-vi-sion. 4. are encouraged to pro-mote out-door ac-tiv-i-ties that older adults can do to stay ac-tive while follow-ing so-cial dis-tanc-ing guide-lines to avoid pro-longed pe-ri-ods of iso-la-tion.
